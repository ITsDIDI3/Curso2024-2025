    <h2>Requirement Analysis</h2>

    <h3>R1: Smart City Domain</h3>
    <p>
        The dataset is highly relevant for the **smart city domain**, specifically in urban sustainability and environmental management. Managing urban greenery, such as trees in parks, contributes to the city's quality of life and sustainability, which are key goals of smart city initiatives.
    </p>

    <h3>R2: CSV Format</h3>
    <p>
        The dataset is available in **CSV format**, which allows for easy processing, transformation into RDF, and linking with other datasets.
    </p>

    <h3>R3: Open License</h3>
    <p>
        The dataset is published under an **open license**, which means it can be freely reused and published, as long as the source is credited. This satisfies the requirement of having a license that allows for open data usage.
    </p>

    <h3>R4: Linkage to Real-World Entities</h3>
    <p>
        The dataset contains real data from parks in the Community of Madrid, allowing linkage to actual locations and urban green spaces. This makes the data easily linkable with other real-world entities such as geographical areas, public services, and environmental monitoring systems.
    </p>

    <h3>Optional Requirement R5: Documentation</h3>
    <p>
        The dataset includes a brief explanatory note, but it lacks extensive documentation. Therefore, while the data is relatively self-explanatory, detailed descriptions of fields or methodologies used are not provided. This partially satisfies this optional requirement.
    </p>

    <h3>Optional Requirement R6: Multiple Data Sources</h3>
    <p>
        The data comes from a single source: the Community of Madrid. Therefore, this optional requirement is not met, as there are no multiple data sources contributing to the dataset.
