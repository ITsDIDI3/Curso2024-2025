    <h1>Application Requirements Specification: Urban Tree Management Application</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The proposed application aims to visualize and analyze the state of trees in urban parks in Madrid. The application will allow users to explore the health and condition of trees across various parks, helping the city government and citizens monitor urban greenery.
    </p>

    <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>FR1:</strong> Interactive map showing the location and condition of trees in different parks.</li>
        <li><strong>FR2:</strong> Ability to filter the trees by their condition (e.g., healthy, damaged) and park location.</li>
        <li><strong>FR3:</strong> Detailed view of each tree, including species information, condition, and maintenance history.</li>
        <li><strong>FR4:</strong> Search functionality to find trees based on park name or tree species.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Non-Functional Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>NFR1:</strong> The application must be intuitive and easy to use, with an accessible design for users of all ages.</li>
        <li><strong>NFR2:</strong> The application should perform efficiently, even when handling large datasets, with minimal loading times for maps and data visualizations.</li>
        <li><strong>NFR3:</strong> The data should be updated regularly to reflect real-time changes in tree health and management activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>User Interface Mock-ups</h2>

    <h3>Main Screen - Interactive Map</h3>
    <p>
        **[Insert image of the mock-up for the main screen here]**<br>
        The main screen will feature an interactive map of Madrid, showing markers for each park. Users can click on a park to view detailed information about the trees in that park, including the overall health of the trees and the species distribution.
    </p>

    <h3>Filter and Search Options</h3>
    <p>
        **[Insert image of the mock-up for filter options here]**<br>
        Users will be able to filter the tree data based on specific criteria such as park location, tree species, or tree condition. A search bar will allow users to directly locate a specific park or tree by name or species.
    </p>

    <h3>Tree Details View</h3>
    <p>
        **[Insert image of the mock-up for tree details here]**<br>
        When a user selects a tree on the map, a detailed view will appear showing the tree's species, current condition, and maintenance history. This information will help users understand the health of the trees and any interventions made by city authorities.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The proposed application will offer a valuable tool for both the city's environmental management team and its citizens to monitor the health and management of trees in urban parks. The ability to visualize the condition of trees across the city will support sustainability efforts and enhance urban quality of life.
